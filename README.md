# 💻 Website

###  Deployment:   https://peopleconvo.com

The site is developed using MERN Stack/ Full Stack with React Node Mongo DB and NextJs. 

* Node js and Mongo DB is used  for building API because its incredibly easy, flexible and easy to scale.
* React is choosen for Frontend because its extremely powerful, performant and recently became so much fun and easy to use with the introduction of hooks.

* NextJs is a framework like React. It takes the development process of React apps to whole new level.NextJs comes with SSR out of the box and SSR is necessary for SEO.
 NextJs starting with version 9 automatically decides if the web page can be served as a static page or dynamic page.

 * If the page is not making request to backend server to fetch data then NextJs automatically serves that page as static page.
 Static pages load extremely fast because they are static. there is no need to wait for server response
